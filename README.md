K-means clustering is a popular algorithm used for grouping data into clusters based on similarity. In the context of grouping customers based on their purchase history, the K-means algorithm can help identify distinct customer segments.

Here's a step-by-step guide to implementing K-means clustering using Python. For this example, weâ€™ll assume you have a dataset with customer purchase history, such as purchase amounts or frequencies.

1. Data Collection
You need a dataset that includes relevant features of customer purchase behavior. For simplicity, let's assume we have a dataset with features such as total_spent, number_of_purchases, and average_purchase_value.

2. Data Preprocessing
Loading Data: Load your dataset.
Handling Missing Values: Handle any missing values in the dataset.
Feature Selection: Choose relevant features for clustering.
Feature Scaling: Normalize or standardize features to ensure that they are on the same scale.
3. Applying K-means Clustering
Determine the Number of Clusters (K): Use methods like the Elbow Method or Silhouette Score to find the optimal number of clusters.
Train the Model: Fit the K-means model on your data.
Assign Clusters: Predict cluster assignments for each customer.
4. Evaluating Clustering
Evaluate the clustering results using metrics such as silhouette score or by analyzing cluster characteristics.

5. Visualizing Clusters
Visualize the clusters to interpret the results better.
